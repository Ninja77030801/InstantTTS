A Text to speech machine that also utilizes special commands<br><br>
In this software, all you need to do is type what you need to say. Once you open it, this will come on the console: <br>
`Enter something to say: ` <br>
And you can type something like this: <br>
`Enter something to say: This is so awesome!` <br>

*But wait! That's not all!* <br>
Did you know that there's also a special command? It's known as `*cal`, and it's used to perform mathematical operations! Here's and example below: <br>
```
   Enter something to say: *cal 43 * 23
   989
```
If you want to use mathematical functions like _cos_, then you need to add the `math.` prefix, like this: <br>

```
Enter something to say: *cal math.cos(math.pi / 6)
0.5
```
